# my-own-blog-api
This is my API that allows a user to delete, update, edit and obviously, post a new blog.  

The outcome screenshot(s) can be found in a folder "results".

Please download the files in a folder, and then in node.js runtime, write "npm i" or "npm install" to get all node_modules. Thank you.
